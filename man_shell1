.SH NAME
shell \- a simple Unix command-line shell written in C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shell
.RI [ script_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell
is a simple Unix command-line interpreter that reads, parses, and executes user commands, either interactively or from a script. It supports command execution, basic built-ins, PATH resolution, and minimal signal handling.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive mode
If launched without arguments and with a connected terminal, the shell enters an interactive prompt loop, displaying a prompt and waiting for user input.
.TP
.B Non-interactive mode
If standard input is redirected or a script is provided, the shell reads commands without prompting.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with the optional exit \fIstatus\fR. If not specified, the last command's status is used.
.TPYouenn
.B env
Displays the current environment variables.
.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B Command execution
Commands are searched using the PATH environment variable. Commands with slashes (e.g., \fI./myprog\fR or \fI/bin/ls\fR) are executed directly.
.TP
.B PATH resolution
Commands without a slash are resolved using the current \fBPATH\fR variable. If \fBPATH\fR is empty or not set, commands are not found.
.TP
.B Error handling
If a command is not found, an error is printed to \fBstderr\fR in the format:
.nf
shell: 1: command: not found
.fi
The exit status is set to 127.
.TP
.B Signal handling
The shell handles \fBSIGINT\fR (Ctrl+C) and avoids exiting on it during interactive mode.
.SH RETURN VALUES
Returns the exit status of the last executed command. If a command is not found, the return code is 127.
